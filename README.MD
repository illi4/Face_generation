# Face generation project

This was a project to define and train a DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) on a dataset of celebrity faces. My goal was to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible. 

Please see the [Jupyter notebook file](Face_generation.ipynb) in this repository.
